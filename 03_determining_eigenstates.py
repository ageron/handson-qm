# Finding Energy Eigenstates: The Shooting Method

In the previous notebooks we solved the time-dependent Schrodinger equation:

$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}|\psi(t)\rangle = \hat{H}|\psi(t)\rangle
$$

We built the Hamiltonian as a matrix, handed it to an ODE solver, and watched wave packets slosh back and forth in harmonic and anharmonic potentials. The state $|\psi(t)\rangle$ was always changing — moving, spreading, developing interference fringes.

But what if we asked a different question: **are there states that don't change at all?** A state $|\psi(t)\rangle$ whose probability density $|\langle x|\psi(t)\rangle|^2$ looks the same at every instant — no sloshing, no spreading, nothing. Such a state would be the quantum equivalent of a standing wave: vibrating in place, but with a shape that never moves.

## Stationary States

For $|\langle x|\psi(t)\rangle|^2$ to be constant in time, all the time dependence in $|\psi(t)\rangle$ must be a global phase — a factor $e^{-iEt/\hbar}$ that multiplies the entire state and cancels out when we take the squared modulus. So we're looking for states of the form:

$$
|\psi(t)\rangle = e^{-iEt/\hbar}|\phi\rangle
$$

Substituting this into the Schrodinger equation, the time derivative pulls down a factor of $E$ and the exponential cancels on both sides, leaving:

$$
\hat{H}|\phi\rangle = E|\phi\rangle
$$

This is an **eigenvalue equation**. The special states $|\phi\rangle$ are called **energy eigenstates**, and the allowed values $E$ are the energy **eigenvalues**. Finding them is one of the central problems in quantum mechanics — once you know all the eigenstates and eigenvalues of a system, you essentially know everything about it.

## Turning It Into a Spatial ODE

To compute anything, we project onto position: $\phi(x) = \langle x|\phi\rangle$. The Hamiltonian $\hat{H} = \hat{T} + \hat{V}$ becomes a differential operator, and the eigenvalue equation reads:

$$
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\phi}{dx^2} + V(x)\phi(x) = E\phi(x)
$$

Rearranging:

$$
\frac{d^2\phi}{dx^2} = \frac{2m}{\hbar^2}\bigl[V(x) - E\bigr]\phi(x)
$$

This is a second-order ODE in *space*. The energy $E$ enters as a parameter. Given any value of $E$, we can pick initial conditions and integrate across $x$ — exactly the way `solve_ivp` integrated the time-dependent equation across $t$ in Notebook 1.

Let's just try it. We'll take the anharmonic potential from Notebook 2 — $V(x) = \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2 x^2 + \lambda x^4$ — pick some energy, and integrate the ODE from left to right to see what $\phi(x)$ looks like.

## Why Does It Blow Up?

The solution oscillates nicely in the classically allowed region (where $E > V(x)$, between the turning points), but once it crosses into the forbidden region on the right it explodes. To understand why, consider what the ODE does in a region where the potential is roughly constant at some value $V_0 > E$:

$$
\frac{d^2\phi}{dx^2} = \frac{2m}{\hbar^2}(V_0 - E)\phi = \kappa^2 \phi
$$

where $\kappa = \sqrt{2m(V_0 - E)}/\hbar > 0$. This is easy to solve by inspection — the general solution is a sum of two exponentials:

$$
\phi(x) = A e^{+\kappa x} + B e^{-\kappa x}
$$

Both are perfectly valid solutions of the ODE. The decaying exponential $e^{-\kappa x}$ is what we'd expect of a quantum particle in a forbidden region: the probability density $|\phi|^2 \propto e^{-2\kappa x}$ drops off rapidly — the particle is exponentially unlikely to be found far from the allowed region. The growing exponential $e^{+\kappa x}$, on the other hand, says the particle becomes *more* likely to be found the further you go into the forbidden region, without limit. Such a solution can't be normalized — $\int|\phi|^2 dx$ diverges. Physicists call these **unphysical solutions** and discard them: meaningful quantum states must live in $L^2$ space, meaning they are square-integrable.

That's exactly what we're seeing above. Our numerical integration starts from the left with some arbitrary initial conditions. As it propagates rightward through the forbidden region, it inevitably picks up a component of the growing exponential — even if only through numerical rounding — and that component takes over, sending $\phi$ to $\pm\infty$.

This is the key insight behind the **shooting method**: only for special values of $E$ — the eigenvalues — does the growing exponential have exactly zero amplitude, leaving a normalizable solution that decays on both sides. To find those special energies, we can monitor $\phi$ at some fixed point in the forbidden region and vary $E$. Let's evaluate $\phi$ at $x = 5$ (well past the right turning point) for a range of energies and see what happens:
"""

## Reading the Plot

This is *not* a wave function — it's the value of the wave function at a single fixed point $x = 5$, deep in the classically forbidden region, plotted as a function of the energy parameter $E$ that we feed into the ODE. For each $E$, we integrated the full ODE from left to right and recorded where $\phi$ ended up at $x = 5$. The signed-log scale compresses the enormous range of values so we can see what's going on.

The pattern is striking. For most energies, the solution has diverged wildly by the time it reaches $x = 5$ — either to hugely positive or hugely negative values. But at certain special energies, the curve crosses zero. At those energies, the solution happens to pass through zero at $x = 5$ instead of diverging.

Now imagine pushing the probe point further out — to $x = 6$, $x = 10$, $x = 100$. The divergences get exponentially worse (the growing exponential $e^{+\kappa x}$ has more room to grow), but the zero crossings stay in the same place. That's the crucial point: at those special energies, the solution doesn't just happen to be small at one particular $x$ — it actually *decays* in the forbidden region. No matter how far out you look, it stays well-behaved.

These are the energies where the ODE has a unique solution (up to normalization) that doesn't blow up — a solution that is square-integrable, that lives in $L^2$. In other words: a normalizable wave function, a physically meaningful quantum state. These are the **energy eigenstates** $|\phi_n\rangle$ with eigenvalues $E_n$, and we've just located them by watching where the divergence changes sign.

## A Ground State, but No Ceiling

Look at the left side of the plot: below the first zero crossing ($E \approx 0.51$), $\phi(x=5)$ stays positive and enormous — it never crosses zero again. No matter how low you make $E$, the solution always diverges the same way. There is a **lowest eigenvalue** (the ground state energy), and no eigenstate below it.

On the right side, the crossings keep coming. As $E$ increases the classically allowed region gets wider, allowing more oscillations in $\phi(x)$ before it hits the forbidden region. There is no upper bound — the spectrum extends to infinity. This is a general feature of confining potentials: a discrete, infinite ladder of energy levels with a bottom rung but no top.
